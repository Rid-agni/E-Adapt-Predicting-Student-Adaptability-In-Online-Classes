# E-Adapt-Predicting-Student-Adaptability-In-Online-Classes

E-Adapt is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict studentsâ€™ adaptability levels in an online education environment. The project includes defining the problem and business objectives, conducting a literature survey, collecting and preparing the dataset, building and comparing multiple classification models, and performing hyperparameter tuning to select the best-performing model. A Random Forest Classifier with optimized parameters was chosen, achieving around 91% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.89. The final model is integrated with a user-friendly interface that allows users to input relevant data and receive real-time adaptability level predictions, supporting educators in making data-driven decisions to enhance online learning experiences.
